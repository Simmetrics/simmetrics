Description

SimMetrics is a Similarity Metric Library, e.g. from edit distance's (Levenshtein, Gotoh, Jaro etc) to other metrics, (e.g Soundex, Chapman). Work provided by UK Sheffield University funded by (AKT) an IRC sponsored by EPSRC, grant number GR/N15764/01.

My clone of the project is not compatable with the original Sourceforge version, I changes a bit of the code and converted the project to an Eclipse project for easy import. I'll maintain this clone and add functionality as I see fit, but I will NOT be submitting any of my changes to the authors of the original project - mainly because I don't think the project is actively maintained there.
