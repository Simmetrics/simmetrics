/**

 * A value of zero indicates that the lists are dissimilar, a value of 1
 * indicates they are similar.

 * The elements in the lists have to implement {@link Object#hashCode()} and
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)}. The similarity measure should be consistent
 * with equals such that {@code a.equals(b) => compare(a,b) == 1.0}.
 * Implementations should also not modify the contents of the list. List should
 * be treated as if wrapped by {@link Collections#unmodifiableList(List)}.
