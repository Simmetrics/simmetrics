/**
 * Measures the similarity between two arbitrary sets containing elements of the

 * value of zero indicates that the sets are dissimilar, a value of 1 indicates
 * they are similar.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The elements in the set have to implement {@link Object#hashCode()} and
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)}.The similarity measure should be consistent
 * with equals such that {@code a.equals(b) => compare(a,b) == 1.0}.
 * Implementations may not modify the contents of the set. Sets should be
 * treated as if wrapped by {@link Collections#unmodifiableSet(Set)}.
