/**
 * Implements the matching coefficient algorithm providing a similarity measure
 * between two lists.
 * <p>
 * The matching coefficient between two lists is defined as ratio of elements
 * that occur in both lists and elements that exclusively occur in either list.
 * This metric is identical to Jaccard similarity. However repeated elements are
 * considered as distinct occurrences.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * similarity(a,b) = (a A b)|  / (|a or b|)
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The A operation takes the list intersection of <code>a</code> and
 * <code>b</code>. This is a list <code>c</code> such that each element in has a
 * 1-to-1 relation to an element in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. E.g.
 * the list intersection of <code>[ab,ab,ab,ac]</code> and
 * <code>[ab,ab,ad]</code> is <code>[ab,ab]</code>. *
 * <p>
 * This metric is identical to Jaccard but is insensitive to repeated tokens.
 * The list <code>["a","a","b"]</code> is identical to
 * <code>["a","b","b"]</code>.
