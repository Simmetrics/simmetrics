/**
 * Measures the similarity between two lists. Idea taken from <a
 * href="http://www.catalysoft.com/articles/StrikeAMatch.html">How to Strike a
 * Match</a> by Simon White.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * similarity(a,b) = 2 * |(a A b)|  / (|a| + |b|)
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The A operation takes the list intersection of <code>a</code> and
 * <code>b</code>. This is a list <code>c</code> such that each element in has a
 * 1-to-1 relation to an element in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. E.g.
 * the list intersection of <code>[ab,ab,ab,ac]</code> and
 * <code>[ab,ab,ad]</code> is <code>[ab,ab]</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This metric is very similar to Dice's coefficient however Simon White used
 * the list intersection rather then the set intersection to prevent list of
 * duplicates from scoring a perfect match against a list with single elements.
 * E.g. 'GGGGG' should not be identical to 'GG'.
