/**
 * Transforms a string into a simpler form.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simplification increases the effectiveness of a metric by removing noise and
 * reducing the dimensionality of the problem. The process maps a a complex
 * string such as <code>Chilp√©ric II son of Childeric II</code> to a simpler
 * format <code>chilperic ii son of childeric ii</code>. This allows string from
 * different sources to be compared in the same normal form.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A simplifier can be added onto a metric through the
 * {@link StringMetricBuilder}.
